# Development container

DevContainers development environment bundling Bash, Go, Make, Git, and the Docker CLI.

## Requirements

- A running Docker Engine and CLI, Docker Desktop, or compatible Docker host.
- For the CLI workflow, install the
  [Dev Container CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/devcontainer-cli):
  `npm install -g @devcontainers/cli`.

## How to run

### Visual Studio Code

1. Install the **Dev Containers** extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`).
2. Open the repository folder and run **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**.
3. Use the integrated terminal to run the commands below. The Go extension is
   installed in the container.

Run **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** after changing the dev container's
Dockerfile or configuration.

### Terminal CLI

Run these commands on the host, from the repository root:

```sh
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash
```

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the local checkout in IntelliJ IDEA. Enable the **Docker** and
   **Dev Containers** plugins and configure the local Docker connection under
   **Build, Execution, Deployment > Docker**.
2. Open `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, click its gutter action, and select
   **Create Dev Container and Mount Sources**. Select IntelliJ IDEA as the backend.
3. Once the container is ready, click **Connect** in the **Services** tool window.
4. Enable the Go plugin in the backend for Go code intelligence and select
   `/usr/local/go` as the Go SDK.

Use **Mount Sources** with this configuration so the checkout paths match those
on the Docker host. See JetBrains' [Dev Container instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/start-dev-container-inside-ide.html)
for the IDE workflow. Rebuild the container after changing its configuration.

## Other aspects to consider

Development sessions run as the non-root `vscode` user so permission-sensitive
unit tests work correctly. On startup, this user joins the mounted Docker socket's
group, allowing Docker-based integration tests without running tests as root. Use `sudo`
only for commands that need elevated permissions.

After updating an existing root-based container, rebuild it in your IDE or run
`devcontainer up --workspace-folder . --remove-existing-container` from the host.
On Linux, files previously created as root may need their ownership corrected
before the non-root user can overwrite them.

The development container is not privileged. Running OBI and its integration
tests still requires the Linux kernel, BTF, and permissions described in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md). Some integration tests access sibling
containers through `localhost`; run those tests on the Linux Docker host, or
configure host networking for the development container. Docker Desktop needs
its host-networking option enabled for that workflow. Building on macOS or
Windows does not make their native kernels capable of running eBPF programs.
