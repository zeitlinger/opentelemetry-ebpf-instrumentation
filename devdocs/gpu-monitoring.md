# GPU monitoring

OBI instruments the CUDA APIs an application uses to drive an NVIDIA GPU:
kernel launches, memory copies, allocations, stream and event operations, and
the introspection calls that reveal which device the work ran on. This is
execution telemetry about the application's GPU work, not device health
telemetry such as utilization, temperature, or power, which comes from tools
like `nvidia-smi` or DCGM.

## Enabling

GPU monitoring is off unless enabled through `ebpf.instrument_cuda`
(`OTEL_EBPF_INSTRUMENT_CUDA`):

| Value          | Behavior                                      |
|:---------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| `auto` (default) | Enabled when `nvidia-smi` is on the `PATH` of the OBI process. |
| `on`           | Always enabled.                               |
| `off`          | Always disabled.                              |

When enabled, `newCommonTracersGroup` in `pkg/appolly/discover/finder.go` adds
the gpuevent tracer to the common tracer set. The tracer is not required: if it
fails to load, the rest of the instrumentation still works.

## Where the code lives

| Piece                         | Location                                        |
|:------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------|

| Event structs shared with Go  | `bpf/gpuevent/cuda.h`                           |

| Integration test              | `internal/test/integration/gpu_metrics_test.go` |

The eBPF program is derived from the `gpuevent_snoop` program in
[strobelight](https://github.com/facebookincubator/strobelight); the header of
`bpf/gpuevent/cuda.c` records the upstream revision.

## Instrumented APIs

OBI attaches uprobes to the CUDA Runtime (`libcudart.so`) and the CUDA Driver
(`libcuda.so`). Calls whose arguments need to be correlated with a result use
entry and return probes; the rest use a single entry probe.

| Library     | Probes          | Symbols |
|:------------|:----------------|:--------|
| `libcudart` | entry + return  | cudaLaunchKernel, cudaGraphLaunch, cudaMalloc, cudaFree, cudaSetDevice, cudaGetDevice, cudaGetDeviceProperties, cudaGetDeviceProperties_v2 |
| `libcudart` | entry           | cudaMemcpy, cudaMemcpyAsync, cudaMemset, cudaStreamCreate, cudaStreamCreateWithFlags, cudaStreamCreateWithPriority, cudaStreamDestroy, cudaEventRecord, cudaEventRecordWithFlags, cudaEventSynchronize, cudaStreamSynchronize, cudaDeviceSynchronize, cudaHostRegister |
| `libcuda`   | entry + return  | cuDeviceGetUuid, cuDeviceGetUuid_v2, cuDeviceGetName |
| `libcuda`   | entry           | cuLaunchKernel, cuLaunchKernelEx, cuGraphLaunch |

Return probes exist where the outcome only becomes known after the call:
`cudaMalloc` reports the allocated pointer and size, `cudaFree` confirms the
release, `cudaSetDevice` confirms which device is now current, and the
introspection calls read the buffers that the callee filled in. Driver API
launches are entry-only because deduplication against the runtime API is done
with a per-thread marker, not with a return value.

## Events and the ring buffer

The eBPF programs push fixed-size events into `gpu_events`, a 64 KB ring
buffer. `processCudaEvent` in `pkg/internal/ebpf/gpuevent/gpuevent.go` decodes
them into spans.

| Event                        | Span type                             | Metric |
|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-------|
| `k_event_kernel_launch`      | `EventTypeGPUCudaKernelLaunch`        | `gpu.cuda.kernel.launch.calls`, `gpu.cuda.kernel.grid.size`, `gpu.cuda.kernel.block.size` |
| `k_event_graph_launch`       | `EventTypeGPUCudaGraphLaunch`         | `gpu.cuda.graph.launch.calls` |
| `k_event_malloc`             | `EventTypeGPUCudaMalloc`              | `gpu.cuda.memory.allocations` |
| `k_event_memcpy`             | `EventTypeGPUCudaMemcpy`              | `gpu.cuda.memory.copies` |
| `k_event_free`               | `EventTypeGPUCudaFree`                | `gpu.cuda.memory.free.bytes` |
| `k_event_memset`             | `EventTypeGPUCudaMemset`              | `gpu.cuda.memset.bytes` |
| `k_event_stream_create`      | `EventTypeGPUCudaStreamCreate`        | `gpu.cuda.stream.create.calls` |
| `k_event_stream_destroy`     | `EventTypeGPUCudaStreamDestroy`       | `gpu.cuda.stream.destroy.calls` |
| `k_event_event_record`       | `EventTypeGPUCudaEventRecord`         | `gpu.cuda.event.record.calls` |
| `k_event_event_synchronize`  | `EventTypeGPUCudaEventSynchronize`    | `gpu.cuda.event.synchronize.calls` |
| `k_event_stream_synchronize` | `EventTypeGPUCudaStreamSynchronize`   | `gpu.cuda.stream.synchronize.calls` |
| `k_event_device_synchronize` | `EventTypeGPUCudaDeviceSynchronize`   | `gpu.cuda.device.synchronize.calls` |
| `k_event_host_register`      | `EventTypeGPUCudaHostRegister`        | `gpu.cuda.host.register.bytes` |
| `k_event_device_info`        | —                                     | — |

`k_event_device_info` carries the device UUID and model that an introspection
call revealed. It produces no span; the Go tracer only caches the pair for
labelling later events.

## Device attribution

Spans and metrics are labelled with the device the calling thread was bound to
when that binding was observed:

| Attribute           | Meaning |
|:--------------------|:--------|
| `cuda.device.index` | Process-local device index. Present when the thread selected or queried a device through `cudaSetDevice` or `cudaGetDevice`; omitted when no binding was observed. |
| `cuda.device.uuid`  | Bare device UUID, the `uuid` column of `nvidia-smi` with its `GPU-` prefix removed. Omitted until the process asked CUDA about the device. |
| `cuda.device.model` | Device name, for example `NVIDIA H20-3e`. Omitted until observed. |

The thread-to-device binding is learned from `cudaSetDevice` and `cudaGetDevice`
and kept per host thread, because CUDA's current device is per host thread. A
failed `cudaSetDevice` does not bind the thread, and a `cudaGetDevice` query does
not change it. Identity is cached per process, and partial observations merge:
an observation that reveals only the UUID or only the name does not clear the
other part.

Because `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` remaps indices, the same index can refer to
different physical GPUs in different processes; the UUID identifies the
physical device.

## Runtime and driver deduplication

`libcudart` implements the launch APIs by calling into `libcuda`, so a process
that maps both libraries would report the same launch twice. A per-thread
in-flight marker is set at the runtime entry probe and consumed by the driver
entry probes, which then report nothing. The runtime return probes clear the
marker for calls that never reach the driver.

## Byte-accurate free accounting

`cudaFree` is not told how large the freed block is, so frees are accounted
using the size recorded at allocation time. The `cudaMalloc` return probe
stores the returned pointer and size, keyed by process and device pointer. The
`cudaFree` probes look the size up and report it once the return probe confirms
the free.

## eBPF maps

Maps are pinned internal to OBI. The per-thread in-flight context maps are
regular hash maps: their matching return probes consume and delete entries
unconditionally, so a deselected or exiting target cannot leak them. The
long-lived state maps (`cuda_alloc_sizes`, `cuda_thread_device`,
`cuda_device_info`) are LRU hashes so entries for processes that exit without
cleaning up are evicted rather than growing without bound.

| Map                       | Type      | Key → value                | Entries | Purpose |
|:--------------------------|:----------|:---------------------------|--------:|:--------|
| `cuda_malloc_ctx`         | hash      | thread → malloc arguments  | 1024    | Correlate `cudaMalloc` arguments with its return value. |
| `cuda_free_ctx`           | hash      | thread → free arguments    | 1024    | Report a free only once its return code confirms it. |
| `cuda_alloc_sizes`        | LRU hash  | (process, pointer) → size  | 65536   | Size lookup for `cudaFree`. |
| `cuda_runtime_launch_ctx` | hash      | thread → marker            | 1024    | Suppress driver launches that a runtime call is proxying. |
| `cuda_thread_device`      | LRU hash  | thread → device index      | 8192    | Current device of each host thread. |
| `cuda_device_info`        | LRU hash  | (process, index) → identity | 4096   | UUID and name revealed by introspection. |
| `cuda_introspect_ctx`     | hash      | thread → context           | 1024    | Carry introspection arguments from entry to return. |
| `cuda_set_device_ctx`     | hash      | thread → context           | 1024    | Bind a thread only after `cudaSetDevice` succeeds. |

## Span fields

GPU span types reuse the generic `Span` fields instead of adding per-call data
to the span:

| Span                              | `ContentLength`          | `SubType`                  |
|:----------------------------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------------|
| kernel launch                     | grid.x × grid.y × grid.z | block.x × block.y × block.z |
| memcpy                            | bytes copied             | `cudaMemcpyKind`           |
| malloc, free, memset, host register | bytes                  | —                          |
| graph launch, stream/event/sync calls | —                    | —                          |

The spans expose these values as `gridSize`, `blockSize`, `size`, and `kind`
span attributes, built by `spanAttributes` in
`pkg/appolly/app/request/span.go`.

## Metrics

GPU metrics are `development` stability and declared in
`schemas/obi/groups/gpu/metrics.yaml`. They carry `cuda.device.index`,
`cuda.device.uuid`, and `cuda.device.model` when the device binding and identity
were observed; `gpu.cuda.memory.copies` also carries `cuda.memcpy.kind`. An em
dash in the unit column means the metric is declared without a unit, a pure
count.

| Metric                             | Instrument | Unit |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------|:-----|
| `gpu.cuda.kernel.launch.calls`     | counter    | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.kernel.grid.size`        | histogram  | 1    |
| `gpu.cuda.kernel.block.size`       | histogram  | 1    |
| `gpu.cuda.graph.launch.calls`      | counter    | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.memory.allocations`      | counter    | By   |
| `gpu.cuda.memory.copies`           | histogram  | By   |
| `gpu.cuda.memory.free.bytes`       | counter    | By   |
| `gpu.cuda.memset.bytes`            | counter    | By   |
| `gpu.cuda.stream.create.calls`     | counter    | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.stream.destroy.calls`    | counter    | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.event.record.calls`      | counter    | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.event.synchronize.calls` | counter    | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.stream.synchronize.calls` | counter   | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.device.synchronize.calls` | counter   | —    |
| `gpu.cuda.host.register.bytes`     | counter    | By   |

The registry is checked against the emitting surface: the GPU integration test
runs weaver in enforce mode, so a metric that is emitted but not declared, or
declared but not emitted, fails the test.

The OTLP exporter emits these metrics in `pkg/export/otel/metrics.go`, and the
Prometheus exporter mirrors them in `pkg/export/prom/prom.go`, both gated by
the GPU instrumentation being enabled.

### Adding a new GPU metric

1. Add the value to the span in `pkg/appolly/app/request/span.go` (and a
   getter for it if the metric needs a new attribute value). If a new event is
   needed, add the C struct to `bpf/gpuevent/cuda.h`, the event to
   `bpf/gpuevent/cuda.c`, then regenerate the bpf2go bindings with
   `mise run generate`.
2. Declare the metric, and any new attribute, in
   `schemas/obi/groups/gpu/metrics.yaml` and
   `schemas/obi/groups/gpu/registry.yaml`.
3. Register the metric and its attributes in
   `pkg/export/attributes/metric.go` and
   `pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go`, adding new attribute names to
   `pkg/export/attributes/names/attrs.go`.
4. Emit it in `pkg/export/otel/metrics.go` and mirror the emitter in
   `pkg/export/prom/prom.go`.
5. Run `mise run generate-schema-docs` to refresh the reference docs under
   `site/docs/`.
6. If the change renames emitted telemetry, record the transformation in
   [telemetry-schema.md](telemetry-schema.md).

## Testing without a GPU

`TestGPUCudaMetrics` in `internal/test/integration/gpu_metrics_test.go` runs
the whole pipeline without NVIDIA hardware. The test builds fake `libcudart.so`
and `libcuda.so.1` libraries from the stub sources in
`internal/test/integration/components/gpu-cuda-tester/`, and
`docker-compose-gpu.yml` forces `OTEL_EBPF_INSTRUMENT_CUDA=on` so the gpuevent
tracer loads.
