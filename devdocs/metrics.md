# OBI metrics

> The full list of metrics OBI exports — names in OTel and Prometheus form, types, units, descriptions, and per-metric attribute defaults — lives in the user-facing OBI docs: <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/obi/metrics/>.
>
> This document is the **developer-internal companion** to that page: it explains how each component's pipeline turns eBPF events into the metrics listed there, where to edit when adding a new one, and the attribute-group composition behind each metric's label set.

Each component has its own pipeline, described in the [pipeline-map doc](pipeline-map.md). In short, each component has its own maps, events, and a set of userspace nodes that add, modify, and export the data obtained from eBPF probes.

## NetO11y

**NetO11y** uses eBPF probes attached at the [TC level in ingress and egress](../bpf/netolly/flows.c) as well as a [socket/filter](../bpf/netolly/flows_sock.c).

The event we're interested in on the kernel side is called `flow_record_t` and on the userspace side is called `NetFlowRecordT`, which is read by a dedicated ringbuffer (exclusive to **NetO11y**) and will be treated as an `ebpf.Record` (defined in [pkg/internal/netolly/ebpf/record.go](../pkg/internal/netolly/ebpf/record.go)) field from there on.

The `ebpf.Record` contains accumulated metrics from a flow, with additional metadata added from the user space. It is the structure that passes all the pipeline nodes to the metric exporters.

The `Attrs` field contains various attributes that can be added to the flow record. In particular, any attributes here must also be added to the `RecordGetters` functions in [pkg/internal/netolly/ebpf/record_getters.go](../pkg/internal/netolly/ebpf/record_getters.go) and `getDefinitions` in [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go). For each metric, other ad hoc attributes are defined (such as `networkCIDR` or `networkInterZoneCIDR`).

In [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go), `networkAttributes` and `networkKubeAttributes` are defined. These are `AttrReportGroup` structures that define groups of attributes allowed by a given metric, whether we're in a k8s environment or not. Note that not all attributes are set to true by default and if you want to enable them, you can do so during configuration using the `attributes` field, which allows you to configure the decoration of some extra attributes that will be added to each metric. Example:

```
attributes:
  select:
    obi_network_flow_bytes:
      include:
      - obi.ip
      - src.address
      - dst.address
      ...
```

In the following methods:

- `newMetricsExporter` in [pkg/export/otel/metrics_net.go](../pkg/export/otel/metrics_net.go) for OTEL
- `newNetReporter` in [pkg/export/prom/prom_net.go](../pkg/export/prom/prom_net.go) for Prometheus

the actual metrics are created using the names defined in [pkg/export/attributes/metric.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric.go) with the attributes defined and added in [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go).

### Add a new network metric

To add a new network metric, follow these guidelines:

1. If new fields are needed on the flow record, extend `flow_record_t` on the eBPF side and the `NetFlowRecordT` / `ebpf.Record` structs on the userspace side.
2. Define the metric `Name` in [pkg/export/attributes/metric.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric.go), wrapping it in `metric(...)` and setting its `Section`, `OTEL`, `Unit` and `Type`. Never set `Prom` by hand: it is derived from the other three.
3. Register the metric in `getDefinitions` in [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go), wiring it to the relevant `AttrReportGroup`s (e.g. `networkAttributes`, `networkKubeAttributes`) and any ad-hoc attributes it needs.
4. If new attributes are introduced, add the matching getters in [pkg/internal/netolly/ebpf/record_getters.go](../pkg/internal/netolly/ebpf/record_getters.go).
5. If the metric is gated by its own feature flag, add the feature bit and its accessor in [pkg/export/feature.go](../pkg/export/feature.go), register the flag name in `FeatureMapper`, and include it in `AnyNetwork()` so it activates the network pipeline. Then run `mise run generate-config-schema` to refresh the config JSON schema and docs.
6. Wire up the metric in the exporters, gating it behind the feature predicate added in step 5 where applicable: `newMetricsExporter` in [pkg/export/otel/metrics_net.go](../pkg/export/otel/metrics_net.go) for OTEL, and `newNetReporter` in [pkg/export/prom/prom_net.go](../pkg/export/prom/prom_net.go) for Prometheus.
7. Register the metric in the schema registry: add a `metric.*` entry in [schemas/obi/groups/network/metrics.yaml](../schemas/obi/groups/network/metrics.yaml).

## AppO11y

**AppO11y** is the component that handles all application-level tasks and generates traces and metrics. Unlike NetO11y, it uses different types of eBPF probes (such as `uprobe`, `kprobe/kretprobe`) and introduces the concept of a `tracer`, which is the component responsible for tracing a given type of application. Specifically, we can divide tracers into two categories: `gotracer` and `generictracer`.

It also has three common tracers:

- `tpinjector`: handles context propagation via both HTTP headers (sk_msg) and TCP options (BPF_SOCK_OPS)
- `logenricher`: handles trace-log correlation
- `gputracer`: handles GPU (CUDA) instrumentation

These tracers are loaded for any tracer group.

That said, let's focus on the metrics.

In **AppO11y**, the `request.Span` (defined in [pkg/appolly/app/request/span.go](../pkg/appolly/app/request/span.go)) struct is populated with all the necessary information and passes through all the nodes of the pipeline, from reading the necessary data from the eBPF maps to exporting the metrics/traces.

In particular, any attribute here must also be added to the functions `SpanOTELGetters`, `SpanPromGetters` in [pkg/appolly/app/request/span_getters_providers.go](../pkg/appolly/app/request/span_getters_providers.go) and `getDefinitions` in [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go).

In [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go) some `AttrReportGroup` type structures are defined for application metrics in both the k8s and non-k8s environment: `appAttributes` and `appKubeAttributes`. Here too, ad hoc attributes such as `httpCommon`, `httpClientInfo`, and so on are added for each metric. There are attributes that default to true and others to false, but which can be enabled by the user during configuration.

In the following methods:

- `setupOtelMeters` in [pkg/export/otel/metrics.go](../pkg/export/otel/metrics.go) for OTEL
- `newReporter` in [pkg/export/prom/prom.go](../pkg/export/prom/prom.go) for Prometheus

the actual metrics are created using the names defined in [pkg/export/attributes/metric.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric.go) with the attributes defined and added in [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go).

### Add a new application metric

To add a new application metric, follow these guidelines:

1. If new fields are needed on the span, extend `request.Span` in [pkg/appolly/app/request/span.go](../pkg/appolly/app/request/span.go) and populate them in the relevant tracer.
2. Define the metric `Name` in [pkg/export/attributes/metric.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric.go), wrapping it in `metric(...)` and setting its `Section`, `OTEL`, `Unit` and `Type`. Never set `Prom` by hand: it is derived from the other three.
3. Register the metric in `getDefinitions` in [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go), wiring it to the relevant `AttrReportGroup`s (e.g. `appAttributes`, `appKubeAttributes`, `httpCommon`, `httpClientInfo`) and any ad-hoc attributes.
4. If new attributes are introduced, add them to `SpanOTELGetters` and `SpanPromGetters` in [pkg/appolly/app/request/span_getters_providers.go](../pkg/appolly/app/request/span_getters_providers.go).
5. Wire up the metric in the exporters: `setupOtelMeters` in [pkg/export/otel/metrics.go](../pkg/export/otel/metrics.go) for OTEL, and `newReporter` in [pkg/export/prom/prom.go](../pkg/export/prom/prom.go) for Prometheus.
6. Don't forget to clean each `Expirer` in [`cleanupAllMetricsInstances()`](../pkg/export/otel/metrics.go).
7. Declare the metric and any new attribute in the schema registry, following [Adding telemetry](../schemas/obi/README.md#adding-telemetry): import an upstream metric OBI emits unchanged, or add a `metric.obi.*` group with every attribute from step 3. Run `mise run lint-schema` and `mise run generate-schema-docs`.
8. Cover the metric in an integration suite whose compose file runs weaver, so live-check validates what is emitted.

## StatsO11y

**StatsO11y** is the component responsible for calculating statistical metrics — for example, TCP RTT or failed-connection counts — across all applications running on a node, regardless of which PID triggered the event. The probes live in [bpf/statsolly](../bpf/statsolly/).

In [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go) some `AttrReportGroup` type structures are defined for stat metrics in both the k8s and non-k8s environment: `statsAttributes` and `statsKubeAttributes`. Here too, ad hoc attributes can be added for each metric. There are attributes that default to true and others to false, but which can be enabled by the user during configuration.

### BPF program naming convention

Every statsolly BPF program follows the pattern `obi_stats_{probe_type}_{kernel_func}[_{purpose}]`, where `purpose` is only appended when two or more probes share the same hook point (e.g. `tcp_close_srtt` vs `tcp_close_io_flush`).

### Add a new stat metric

To add a new metric, follow these guidelines:

1. Decide on the hook point where you want to attach the eBPF probe. For example, you can use a kprobe on the `tcp_close` function to retrieve `srtt_us`.
2. Add a unique flag that indicates an event related to the metric you want to calculate in [bpf/statsolly/types.h](../bpf/statsolly/types.h) and the corresponding Go constant in [stat.go](../pkg/internal/statsolly/ebpf/stat.go), for example, `k_event_stat_tcp_rtt` and `StatTypeTCPRtt`.
3. Add the eBPF probe to the [bpf/statsolly](../bpf/statsolly/) folder, following the naming convention above. The metric will be calculated and sent to userspace using the `stats_events` ringbuffer.
4. Add the metric's feature bit and accessor in [pkg/export/feature.go](../pkg/export/feature.go), register the flag name in `FeatureMapper`, and include it in the `FeatureStats` aggregate if it should be part of the umbrella `stats` feature. Then run `mise run generate-config-schema` to refresh the config JSON schema and docs.
5. Wire the probe into [stats_tracer.go](../pkg/internal/statsolly/ebpf/stats_tracer.go):
    - add a program name constant (e.g. `progObiStatsKprobeTCPCloseSrtt`) matching the C symbol;
    - add a hook-point constant (kernel function name for kprobes, `group/name` for tracepoints);
    - add an entry to the appropriate `kprobes`/`kretprobes`/`tracepoints`/`raw tracepoints` slice inside `NewStatsFetcher`, with `enabled` driven by the `features.StatsXxx()` predicate added in step 4. Disabled probes are replaced with a no-op stub before loading, preventing unused eBPF code from being loaded into the kernel.
6. In the [tracer_ringbuf.go](../pkg/internal/statsolly/stats/tracer_ringbuf.go), simply add a function that handles that metric. This function will convert the event to a `ebpf.Stat`.
7. Then, modify the `Stat` struct accordingly, by adding a data structure containing all the necessary fields. For example `TCPRtt` struct.
8. Define the metric `Name` in [pkg/export/attributes/metric.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric.go), wrapping it in `metric(...)` and setting its `Section`, `OTEL`, `Unit` and `Type`. Never set `Prom` by hand: it is derived from the other three.
9. Register the metric in `getDefinitions` in [pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go](../pkg/export/attributes/attr_defs.go), wiring it to the relevant `AttrReportGroup`s (e.g. `statsAttributes`, `statsKubeAttributes`) and any ad-hoc attributes it needs.
10. If new attributes are introduced, add the matching getters to `StatGetters` in [pkg/internal/statsolly/ebpf/stat_getters.go](../pkg/internal/statsolly/ebpf/stat_getters.go).
11. Wire up the metric in the exporters. Each exporter owns one observe-method per stat type (e.g. `observeTCPRtt`, `observeTCPFailedConnections`) that translates the `ebpf.Stat` into a given observation, with its attribute set resolved through the attribute selector's `For` method:

    - `newStatsReporter` in [pkg/export/prom/prom_stats.go](../pkg/export/prom/prom_stats.go) for Prometheus
    - `newStatMetricsExporter` in [pkg/export/otel/metrics_stats.go](../pkg/export/otel/metrics_stats.go) for OTEL

12. Register the metric in the schema registry: add a `metric.*` entry in [schemas/obi/groups/stats/metrics.yaml](../schemas/obi/groups/stats/metrics.yaml).

### Known limitations

#### `src.port` may be reported as `0`

The `src.port` attribute (disabled by default) can be `0` in metrics whose probes fire near socket teardown: specifically `obi_stat_tcp_rtt_seconds` and `obi_stat_tcp_failed_connections_total`. Metrics measured while the socket is still active (retransmits) are not affected. The root cause is a kernel-side race between the application's `close()` path and RST processing.

When a socket **receives** a RST and is orphaned (`SOCK_DEAD` set), the kernel calls:

```
tcp_done()
  └── inet_csk_destroy_sock()
        └── inet_put_port()  <-- zeroes skc_num (the source port)
```

This happens outside the application's `close()` call. By the time `parse_sock_info` in [bpf/common/sockaddr.h](../bpf/common/sockaddr.h) reads `skc_num`, it is already `0`.

The RST **sender** is not affected because it goes through the normal application `close()` path where the port is still valid at probe time.

StatsO11y probes fire at different points relative to `inet_put_port()`, so the behaviour is not uniform across metrics. For example, `obi_kprobe_tcp_close_srtt` (kprobe on `tcp_close`) may still observe a valid port in some RST-receiver scenarios, while `obi_tracepoint_inet_sock_set_state` (tracepoint on `inet_sock_set_state`) consistently sees `0`. Metrics with `src_port="0"` still carry useful signal — `dst_port`, `src_address`, `dst_address`, `reason`, and `network_tcp_handshake_role` remain valid.

### Performance considerations

Some stat metrics attach to kernel functions that are called very frequently (e.g. `tcp_sendmsg`, `tcp_cleanup_rbuf` for TCP IO). These probes add a small overhead on every call, so the aggregate cost is proportional to the rate of TCP sends/receives on the node. Consider:

- If you need RTT, failed connections, or retransmits **without** TCP IO overhead, enable those individually (`stats_tcp_rtt`, `stats_tcp_failed_connections`, `stats_tcp_successful_connections`, `stats_tcp_retransmits`) instead of using the `stats` aggregate feature — `stats` includes `stats_tcp_io`, which fires on every `tcp_sendmsg` and `tcp_cleanup_rbuf` call.
- The `stats_events` ring buffer and the per-metric eBPF maps (e.g. `tcp_io_accum`) have default size limits; on nodes with a very large number of concurrent connections these can be resized via the `ebpf.*` configuration knobs if events start being dropped.

### Final notes

We decided to create a component separate from **AppO11y** and **NetO11y**, focusing only on **statistical metrics** calculated for all applications running on the node. This is because statistical metrics are important if correlated to all applications, and also because some hook points can cause unreliable PID calculations and lead to false positives.

The user can then filter the metrics in userspace using appropriate filters or even the collector.

## General notes

Span Metrics, Service Graph Metrics and the info metrics carry no `Section`, because user-provided attribute selection is disabled for them: they are very specific metrics with an opinionated format. They are still declared once — span metrics in [metric_spanmetrics.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric_spanmetrics.go), service graph in [metric_service_graph.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric_service_graph.go), the `target.info` family in [metric_internal.go](../pkg/export/attributes/metric_internal.go) — so that both exporters read the same definition — the `OTEL` exporter takes `.OTEL` and `.Unit`, the `Prometheus` exporter takes the `.Prom` name derived from them. Do not add a new metric of this kind as a literal in either exporter.

Resource attributes exported through Prometheus `target_info` / `traces_target_info` (named `target.info` / `traces.target.info` on the OTLP path) and the corresponding OTLP resources can be filtered with `attributes.select.resource`. By default, detected resource attributes are preserved. For example:

```yaml
attributes:
  select:
    resource:
      exclude:
        - cloud.account.id
        - cloud.resource_id
        - host.image.id
        - host.type
        - k8s.pod.name
```

**Note**: a metric is defined using the `Name` type, which carries the metric's `Section`, its `OTEL` name, `Unit` and instrument `Type`, plus the `Prom` name derived from those. Subsequently, that metric can be a counter, gauge, or other type.
