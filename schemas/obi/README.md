# OBI semantic-convention registry

This registry (see `manifest.yaml`) extends the upstream OpenTelemetry
semantic-conventions registry with the signals and attributes OBI emits in
addition to — or as overrides of — the standard semconv set. Together with the
upstream dependency it forms the complete contract of what OBI emits

## Adding telemetry

Every metric, span or attribute OBI starts emitting over OTLP must be declared
here in the same change:

- **An upstream metric emitted unchanged** (same name, unit, instrument and
  data-point attributes): import it in the domain's `imports.yaml`, as
  `groups/nodejs/imports.yaml` and `groups/dotnet/imports.yaml` do.
- **An upstream metric OBI emits differently**, or one of OBI's own: add a
  `metric.obi.<metric_name>` group to `groups/<domain>/metrics.yaml` listing
  every attribute the metric's `attr_defs.go` section can carry, each with a
  requirement level.
- **A span**: add its attributes to the `span.obi.*` group of the emitter branch
  that produces it, or add a group for a new branch, and a case to
  `internal/schemacheck/emitted_contract_test.go`.
- **An attribute upstream does not define**: declare it in the domain's
  `registry.yaml` under `registry.obi.<namespace>`.

Then run `mise run lint-schema` and `mise run generate-schema-docs`, and make sure an
integration suite that runs weaver exercises the new telemetry (see below).

## What validation covers

Checked on every change, without running OBI:

- `mise run lint-schema`: the registry resolves and is well-formed.
- `internal/schemacheck`: every signal attribute declares a requirement level;
  the span attributes the exporter emits for each case in
  `emitted_contract_test.go` match their `span.obi.*` group exactly; OBI's
  copies of upstream metrics keep upstream's unit, instrument and stability, and
  win resolution over the upstream group.

Checked only when an integration suite that runs weaver exercises it:

- Weaver live-check sees what OBI actually sent and fails on an undeclared
  metric (`missing_metric`), an undeclared attribute (`missing_attribute`), an
  enum value the registry does not list, or a `required` metric attribute that
  is missing.

Not enforced today:

- There is no deterministic check that every metric in
  `pkg/export/attributes/metric.go` is declared; an undeclared metric fails
  only once a weaver-validated suite emits it.
- Spans are not matched to a `span.obi.*` group by live-check, which checks each
  span attribute against the registry as a whole. Group membership, span kind
  and required span attributes are checked only for the cases in
  `emitted_contract_test.go`.
- `conditionally_required` conditions are prose and are not evaluated.
- Span names, and output specific to the Prometheus exporter, are not described
  by the registry.

## Overriding an upstream definition

Weaver has **no precedence or merge semantics** between a local group and the
groups a dependency contributes to the resolved registry (OBI's group files
`import` the definitions they refine and `ref` the attributes they emit, both
of which pull the upstream groups in). When the same attribute id is
declared by more than one group, live-check silently resolves
the duplicate in favor of the group whose id sorts **last lexicographically** —
including the upstream `span.*` / `metric.*` groups that `ref` an attribute
and therefore carry an embedded copy of its upstream definition. Tracked
upstream in <https://github.com/open-telemetry/weaver/issues/1578>.

Until weaver defines local-wins override semantics, every override in
`groups/` must follow these rules:

1. **Group id**: use the `x.obi.<namespace>` prefix so the override sorts
   after every upstream group id (`registry.*`, `span.*`, `metric.*`, …) and
   wins the resolution. Do not rename an override to something that sorts
   earlier, and do not reuse an upstream group id (a same-id redefinition
   loses the tie to the dependency AND trips `DuplicateGroupId` in
   `registry check`).
2. **Replacement, not merge**: an override REPLACES the upstream attribute
   definition wholesale. An enum override must therefore carry the FULL
   upstream member list plus OBI's extensions; when bumping the semconv
   dependency, re-sync the upstream members verbatim from
   `.deps/upstream-<version>/model/<ns>/registry.yaml`. A missing member
   resurfaces as an `undefined_enum_variant` failure in the weaver-validated
   suites, so drift is caught, not silent.
3. **Expected lint duplicates**: `weaver registry check` flags each override
   as a `DuplicateAttributeId` error even though
   live-check resolves it. Each expected duplicate is allowlisted — tightly,
   by attribute id and group pair — in `scripts/lint-schema-filter.jq`
   (covered by `scripts/lint_schema_filter_test.go`). Anything else still
   fails `mise run lint-schema`.

## Group ids

A metric group's id is `metric.obi.<metric_name>`, derived from the metric it
declares so the two cannot drift apart.

Do not rely on that id sorting after the upstream `metric.<metric_name>` group.
It does for most namespaces, but `obi.` loses to any namespace ordering after
it: `metric.obi.rpc.client.call.duration` sorts before
`metric.rpc.client.call.duration`, and the `target.info` / `traces.*` ids lose
to `metric.t*` the same way. What keeps the local definition authoritative is
that live-check runs without `--include-unreferenced`, so unreferenced upstream
groups drop out of resolution and only one group per metric name survives.
`TestOBIMetricOverridesResolveToLocalNarrowedDefinition` fails closed if that
stops holding.

Attribute groups declaring OBI-own attributes use `registry.obi.<namespace>`;
overrides of an upstream attribute use `x.obi.<namespace>` per the rules above.
An attribute group that declares no attribute of its own and exists only as the
base a signal's groups `extends` is named after that signal — the messaging span
groups share `span.obi.messaging.common` — so it stays out of the attribute
pages, which document what OBI defines.

## Two override styles

- **Closed enum, extended**: the upstream value space is enumerable and OBI
  intentionally emits extra members (e.g. `messaging.system` gains
  `amqp`/`mqtt`/`nats`, `db.system.name` gains `aerospike`). The override
  re-declares the enum with upstream members + OBI's, so weaver still flags
  any value outside the combined list — bug values like an empty string or
  `unknown` are deliberately NOT declared on these overrides and keep failing
  the suites. This applies to overrides of upstream enums only. OBI's own
  attributes (`direction`, `reason`, `network.tcp.handshake.role`) do declare
  `unknown`, where it is a meaningful classification rather than a bug: OBI
  genuinely cannot always determine a flow's direction or why a handshake
  failed.
- **Open-ended value space, re-typed as string**: upstream declares an enum,
  but the real value space is unbounded by design — domain-specific error
  codes (`error.type`) or provider operation vocabularies
  (`gen_ai.operation.name`). Enumerating these is impossible, so the override
  re-types the attribute as a plain `string` with examples. Weaver then
  validates presence/type but not membership. For these attributes the
  emitters must still omit the attribute instead of sending an empty value;
  that guarantee lives in the emitter unit tests
  (`pkg/appolly/app/request/span_getters_test.go`,
  `pkg/export/otel/traces_test.go`), not in weaver.

Values OBI merely passes through from user configuration (e.g.
`deployment.environment.name` from a workload's `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`)
are NOT overridden: the integration tests must configure values that satisfy
the upstream conventions instead.
